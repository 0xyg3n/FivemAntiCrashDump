> # How Does it Work?
> * Download The Release file unzip it and simply run it! 
> * https://github.com/0xyg3n/FivemAntiCrashDump/releases/tag/1.1
> * It automatically gets the path for you.
> * It saves the path to the config file.
> * It is able to block the host of the dump server to etc/hosts
> * In case the default path is not detected, simply change the path from the config file.

>
> * Run The Executable file "FivemAntiCrashDump".
> Now every 8 sec a check will be made to the path in order to clean the dumps.
>
> * If there is a crash dump file it will be deleted and you will be notified with a beep sound that the file has been deleted.
> * If you want to stay protected each time you turn on your computer, just run the executable and you will be fine.
